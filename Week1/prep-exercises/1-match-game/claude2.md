## Prompt

File #main.js contains the start code for a game as an exercise for students to complete by replacing the TODO with their own code. Can you complete the README file with the appropriate instructions? Do not complete the code yourself.

## Response

I'll help you complete the README file with appropriate instructions for the match game exercise. First, let me examine the existing files to understand the structure and current state of the exercise. Now I understand the structure. This is a "sticks game" (also known as Nim) where players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 sticks, and the player who removes the last stick wins. The starter code has TODO sections that students need to complete. Let me update the README with proper instructions. 

Made changes.

Perfect! I've completed the README file for the match game exercise. The README now provides comprehensive instructions for students that include:

## Key Features Added:

1. **Clear Overview** - Explains what the game is (sticks/Nim game) and the objective
2. **Game Rules** - Lists the specific rules students need to understand
3. **File Structure** - Shows which files are complete vs. need work
4. **Detailed Task Description** - Breaks down exactly what needs to be implemented:
   - `updateToTheNextPlayer()` function
   - `endTheGame()` function  
   - Button event listeners
5. **Helpful Hints** - Provides specific DOM manipulation and JavaScript concepts they'll need
6. **Testing Guidelines** - Clear criteria for verifying their solution works correctly
7. **Learning Objectives** - Educational goals the exercise addresses

The instructions are student-friendly and provide enough guidance to complete the exercise without giving away the actual code implementation. Students will learn important DOM manipulation concepts, event handling, and game state management while building a functional two-player game.
